<h2> Project Information </h2>
In this project, I had to write a Python program that stores usernames and password. There were several rules to this project. You couldn't enter the same user and password. Password must contain at least 2 uppercase letters, 2 numbers, 8 characters, and must not include special characters such as 'space', '=', '?', etc. There were a lof of rules, click the link to learn more.

<h2> My Contribution </h2>
This project was individual. I used a lof if if-else statements. I used while loop to pretty much loop the entire program until the user tells to quit. Click the link to see my code.

<h2> My Experience </h2>
I'm not going to lie, i had fun doing this project. I mean It was very frustrating but it was still very satisfying to do when you get a part right. Unfortunately, i was unable to fully complete it. I was able to store usernames but the password kept looping even when it satisfies it's requirement. I almost forgot about this project, but I'll fix it eventually when I have to time.
