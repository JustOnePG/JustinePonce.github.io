<h2> Project Information </h2>
In this project, I had to write a Python program that stores usernames and passwords. There were several rules to this project. You couldn't enter the same username and password. Password must contain at least 2 uppercase letters, 2 numbers, 8 characters, and must not include special characters such as 'space', '=', '?', etc. 
<h2> My Contribution </h2>
This project was individual. I used a lot of if-else statements to iterate and check every individual string. I used the while loop to loop the entire program until the user tells to quit. 

<h2> My Experience </h2>
I'm not going to lie, I had fun doing this project. I mean It was very frustrating but it was still very satisfying to do when you get a part right. I did this during my first year and I never had coding experience prior. So, I was proud of myself I could even make this. Unfortunately, I was unable to fully complete it. I was able to store usernames but the password kept looping even when it satisfied its requirement. I almost forgot about this project, but I'll fix it eventually when I have to time.

## My Code
```ruby
username = []
password = []
u = username.append(input('Enter a Username: '))
p = password.append(input('Enter a Password: '))

print('Press 1 to sign up')
print('Press 2 to change password')
print('Press Q or q to quit')
option = input()
while True:
    if option == '1':
        print('Enter a username')
        user = input()
        if user in username:
            print('Username is already taken. Enter a new username')
        else:
            username.append(user)
            print('Enter new password')
            pas = input()
            count = 0
            if count == 3:
                break
            else:
