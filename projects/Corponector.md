# Project Information
The primary goals of this project are to enhance Job and Internship Visibility and make it easy for students to explore a wide range of opportunities from numerous companies.
It will also streamline connections so that it allow companies to post details about potential positions and recruit students with the necessary skills and interests.
It will match skills and interests. It enables students to create profiles with their skills and career preferences, while companies can specify the skills they look for in candidates.
It provides support admin oversight. The administrators will have the ability to monitor site content, add new skill or location categories, and manage the platform. At the same time, students can create profiles on the site with their interests. The site can match students to employers and vice-versa.

# My Contribution
I pretty much did everything on the search page.

It can filter Students and Companies. Tags include Location, Skills, and Positions. Includes Student and Company Cards with basic information. Clicking Cards will go to their profile. Search by Student or Company name

Clicking on the student card will load the student profile which includes the student's basic information.

Clicking Company Card will load the company profile which includes company basic information and open positions for the company

I also added the adding positions when creating a company profile, which you can add as many positions as you want.

Lastly, I created the company page. This includes company basic information, open positions for the company student card for recommended Students, and the edit page where you can edit your profile.

# My Experiences
Overall, I was surprised that it was actually quite fun making this website. It wasn't as stressful as I imagined. It was still stressful but when I got it right, the positive nullified the negative completely. I really don't know, it was just fun creating this website. When I got it working, it was the most satisfying feeling I had. In conclusion, even if I had to do most of the work, I don't feel a grudge or anything, it's just very satisfying to finish it.
