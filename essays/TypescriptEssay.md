  # Const TypeRIP =  (Essay: Professional Essay) => {
  
  Javascript with syntax types?! So thats it? What, were some kind of Typescript. 
  That's what I think of typescript, like some suicide squad. You write an a Java code, 
  and if you don't specifically write what specific type it is, it dies. What, you wrote       a number? 
  How do I know you actually wrote a number? Hmmmmm, what if you wrote a number that is        not a number 
  but is a number? Hmmmmmmmmm. Did I write 'a' number? How would you know I wrote a            number if I didn't
  specifically specify that I wrote a number? Yep. This is a professional Essay. Since I       specified that it's a constant Professional Essay, it must be a constant profesional Essay. Why else would I specify otherwise.
