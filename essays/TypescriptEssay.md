Javascript with syntax types?! So thats it? What, were some kinds of Typescripts? 
That's what I think of typescript, like some suicide squad. You write a Java code, 
and if you don't specifically write what specific type it is, it dies. I specified that this Essay type is Professional. 

This is my first time doing javascript and typescript. I first finished the Pregame Introduction to Javascript thinking it was the one that was required to do but it wasn't. So,  I had to redo another 100+ tutorials. The FreeCodeCamp was a lot easier to do since they are very similar to each other. When I finally got to Typescript, I thought "WOW!! It's the same thing." I thought it would be different, so  doing the practice WODs I didn't really have a problem doing them. Overall, I need to experience more of Typescript to form a more cohesive opinion about it. 

I feel that the class structure is very confusing, to me anyway. There is barely any lecture and as you said, we will mostly be doing work and have to learn the materials ourselves. I know we have the course website that will guide us but that's it. We just read each module and follow instructions. The WODs  sound very stressful and unfair. It's all or nothing. Especially when we have to learn them ourselves, but we will see. Maybe I need to get used to the change since I'm used to regular class lectures. In conclusion, this class has its own structure and maybe I need to get used to it.
