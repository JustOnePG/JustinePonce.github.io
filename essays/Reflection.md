# Mirror Mirror On The Wall

Who's the deceiver of them all? AI of course. Seriously though, this is more than just the usage of AI. I didn't take this class seriously because I can just use AI, and I'm in computer engineering so, web development isn't really my thing. But, it doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. The two things that interested me in this class was the development environments and agile project Management.

# Development Environment
In coding, a development environment is like a specialized workspace where programmers build software. It allows developers to write, test, and refine their code to ensure that their code works perfectly fine. This class made me remember how much I loved VScode. I have used VScode in my previous classes such as ECE205. When I used it I instantly fell in love with it. It just made coding easier because you can just install extensions. VScode can be a bit bloaty but only if you are focusing on one language. VScode is meant to easily switch different language fast and easy. So, Development Environments really helped me remember how much I adored coding back then. It was simple, especially Python, but now it's all just confusion. VScode also has GitHub co-pilot which is an AI helper useful for fixing syntax errors.
