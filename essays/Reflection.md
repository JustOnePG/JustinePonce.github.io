# Mirror Mirror On The Wall

Who's the deceiver of them all? AI of course. Seriously though, this is more than just the usage of AI. I didn't take this class seriously because I can just use AI, and I'm in computer engineering so, web development isn't really my thing. But, it doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. The two things that interested me in this class was the development environments and agile project Management.

# Development Environment
In coding, a development environment is like a specialized workspace where programmers build software. It allows developers to write, test, and refine their code to ensure that their code works perfectly fine. This class made me remember how much I loved VScode. I have used VScode in my previous classes such as ECE205. When I used it I instantly fell in love with it. It just made coding easier because you can just install extensions. VScode can be a bit bloaty but only if you are focusing on one language. VScode is meant to switch different languages quickly and easily. So, Development Environments really helped me remember how much I adored coding back then. It was simple, especially Python, but now it's all just confusion. VScode also has GitHub co-pilot which is an AI helper useful for fixing syntax errors. 

# Agile Project Management
Agile Project Management really helped me form the team together. None of my teammates took the initiative. They always stayed quiet. Even when creating the team name, they couldn't agree on something. One of my teammates even used AI to get a team name. So, I had to take the initiative, or else we couldn't start our project. This module really helped me a lot because watching the short videos and reading the prompts, helped me understand how to get things started. It taught me how to collaborate efficiently and plan how we are going to do our project. The first thing I did was use the nextJS template from the Application Designs. Then made our team name Corponectors because I was playing Cyberpunk 2077 and they used Corpos a lot which is short-term for corporations. I then told my team to create our .io page because I couldn't do everything else I would be doing everything. After that, it went smoothly from there. They were still quiet even if we were all together, they still spoke in discord, which is fine by me.
