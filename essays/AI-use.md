## I. Introduction
Ai is a blessing to many students including I, but deep down we all know it's a curse in disguise. Don't get me wrong, it definitely is helpful, but most of the time, we don't use it to learn, we use it to get grades. Throughout the semester, I have used chatGPT and GitHub co-pilot. This semester, I  have been very AI tool-reliant. I used it more than the rest of my previous semester combined. Well, it's because of this class. I'm not built for coding.

## II. Personal Experience 
# Experience Wods
  I didn't use it in experience WODs because they were easy enough to do on your own, and I still had the learning mentality. 
# Inclass Practic3 Wods
I didn't use it here because it's not graded, there is no point in using it if it's worth nothing. A terrible mistake on my part because I should have used it to learn the concept. Asking AI for the steps and explaining how it did it would have definitely helped me understand important concepts. 
# Essays
I only used it once, which was the 'Till design do us part'. I only used it because I forgot about it. I mean the essay prompt was easy, I just didn't have the energy to actually work on it. I already had the idea which was to be like a marriage and a breakup because it just made sense in my head. But even if I used it, it turned out to be very much fitting that I used AI.

# Final Project
For the final project, it was mostly copy-and-paste. I copied and pasted from pretty much all the practice Wods, Wods, and especially the Application designs. Then I just change the variables and make them all match. If it didn't work I used GitHub co-pilot to fix them and use it to format how I want the page to look like. I had no choice but to use a lot of it because I had to do 70% of the project. Everything on the search page including the student and company profile.
