## UI Framework
A coding language like no other. It can be very complicated to learn but when you get the gist of it, it's still frustrating. However, the use of it is worth learning. 
## Boostrap5
This framework adds many icons, to the raw HTML and CSS. A website's goal is to catch the eye of a visitor and be organized so that it is easy to navigate through. UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 do just that, It is up to the software engineer to organize how it is used. So, the full benefits of UI frameworks depend on the software engineer's ability to use them wisely. 
## MY Experience
So far, UI Framework has been very frustrating to me, but so very well informative.
