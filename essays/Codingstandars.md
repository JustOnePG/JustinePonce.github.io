## Coding Standards

Are very important in Coding. The standards can be abit annoying but it helps with the organization and readability of your code. In programming, most of the time, you will not be the only one working on the same tasks. You will have to update or fix an already existing code. It is vital for codes to be readable and organzed so that it can be easily read and know
Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with VSCode, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting rid of all the ESLint errors is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.
