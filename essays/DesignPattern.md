## Design Pattern,
I take you as my trusted guide in the world of code and logic. 
I promise to use your wisdom in every function I create and value your structure when things get tough or easy. 
I will rely on your Singleton to keep things consistent, trust your Adapter to bring order where there’s confusion, and follow your Observer to make sure everything works together. 
Whether the system needs to grow or stay simple, whether it’s about speed or keeping it organized, I promise to stick to your tried-and-true solutions. 
From my first line of code to my last project, I am committed to you. Till Design Do Us Part.

## I want a Divorce

I’m sorry, but I think it’s time to say goodbye. You’ve been my trusted partner in coding, helping me solve problems and build systems that worked beautifully. 
I’ve learned so much from you, and you’ve always been there to guide me with your Observer. 
Helping me find the state changes in another object, like how I found what was wrong with our database objects not showing on our final project website.
But things have changed—I’ve started using ChatGPT to solve my problems. 
It’s quick, easy, and gives me answers almost instantly, and I’ve started relying on it instead of your timeless designs. 
It’s not your fault; I’ve just grown used to this new way of doing things. 
Maybe one day I’ll come back to you, but for now, I need to move on.

Yours Truly,
J
