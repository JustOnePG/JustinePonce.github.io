Discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

<h2> Hard & Soft</h2>
I'm going soft, I've always been hard. Hard as a steel, now my wares are soft. I'm talking about hardwares of course. My interest has always been hardwares. I've never dabbled into softwares, but the more I learn about it, the more I don't want to learn about it. Hardwares are easy, you just plug and play with a bit of common sense. Softwares, however, you need to use your brain. It requires a lot of thinking, researching, praying, frustrating, dying, resurrecting, dying again, restarting, pretty much everything. But, since I learned about softwares, I now know hardwares are nothing but a shell without the softwares. Softwares are the brains to the hardwares. It instruct them how to perform their tasks. So, now my interest has shifted to softwares, like a soft reboot.

<h2> I Hope </h2>
In the future I hope to understand how softwares interact with their respective hardwares. I hope to experience more of building softwares to make hardwares do it's purpose like my FPGA project. The process to make a software work if extremely frustrating, I hope it gets less stressfull and is easier to cope the more experience I gain. Lastly, I just hope I get to be more confidence in my work. Frustrations comes from doubts, I hope doubting myself will be a thing in the past.
